            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Devasish Mishra, a tech-enthusiastic learner who recently completed Class 12 with PCM, English, and Computer Science. From an early age, I was exposed to technology through my father’s smartphone shop, where I’ve spent 8+ years observing and assisting customers — which helped me develop strong communication and problem-solving skills. Known in my town as the go-to person for solving mobile and desktop issues, I’ve also earned academic honors like the Class 10 School Topper award and Maths Excellence in Class 3. I’ve served as Head Boy and Head of All Departments through school elections for three consecutive years. I’m passionate about web development and have already built a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My short-term goal is to become a full-stack developer, and my long-term dream is to become an AI specialist and build a startup that creates real value for India. I’m curious, self-driven, and always ready to learn.

                    classroom technology, specifically screen projectors and desktops. I was also responsible for
